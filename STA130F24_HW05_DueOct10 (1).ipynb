A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence, but it does not definitively prove anything. Similarly, using only the p-value, you cannot definitively prove that Fido is guilty or not guilty. The p-value tells us whether the data is consistent with the null hypothesis (such as not guilty), but it does not provide absolute proof. p-values ​​measure evidence, not certainty. They are only suggestions, not proofs."

    "In a two-sided test, the hypothesis tests whether the data are different from the null hypothesis in either direction. Thus, it evaluates both extremes of the distribution. The current code might calculate the p-value by considering the probability of obtaining values as extreme as the observed data in both tails of the distribution. For a one-sided test, we are only interested in deviations in one direction. This will change the hypothesis to check whether the observations are significantly greater or significantly less than the null hypothesis, but only in one direction. We will modify the code to compute the probability of only one tail of the distribution, rather than summing the probabilities of the two tails. Switching to a one-sided test focuses the hypotheses more and can provide stronger evidence for an effect in a particular direction, but it also limits the scope of the test by ignoring the opposite direction altogether. Yes, we expect the unilateral test to have a smaller p-value than the two-sided test because we are only considering one tail of the distribution. This means that we ignore extreme results in the opposite direction."

    "### Fisher's Tea Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "A most beloved piece of [statistical lore](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2012.00620.x) about the (most famous) statistician Ronald Fisher involves cups of tea with milk. Fisher and his friend and colleague, Dr. Muriel Bristol, worked at Cambridge in the 1920s and regularly had tea together. During one of their afternoon tea times, Bristol refused a cup of tea from Fisher because he put milk in first BEFORE pouring in the tea. Bristol said she could taste the difference, and much preferred the taste of tea when the milk was poured in afterward the tea. Fisher didn't think that there could be a difference and proposed a hypothesis test to examine the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher made 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk added in first and 4 with tea added in first, and gave them to Dr. Bristol without her seeing how they were made and she would say if she thought the tea or the milk was poured first. As it turned out, Bristol correctly identified if the tea or milk was poured first for all 8 of the cups. Fisher, being a skeptical statistician wanted to test if this could be happening by chance with Bristol just randomly guessing (or whether there was evidence against an assumption of Bristol just randomly guessing), and subsequently designed a statistical hypothesis test to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you run an experiment like this with students in STA130. You get a random sample of 80 STA130 students to each taste one cup of tea and tell you whether they think the milk or tea was poured first. **Suppose 49 students are able to correctly state which was poured first.** Provide a statistical analysis of this experiment as guided through the following set of questions.\n",

    "Problem Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment, we replicate an experiment inspired by Ronald Fisher’s famous \"Tea Experiment,\" where we test whether a group of 80 STA130 students can correctly identify whether tea or milk was poured first into a cup. The sample data shows that 49 out of 80 students correctly identified the order. We aim to determine if this outcome is statistically significant, or if it could be attributed to random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Between This Experiment and Fisher and Bristol’s Experiment\n",
    "In Fisher’s original experiment, the goal was to test Dr. Muriel Bristol’s ability to correctly identify how her tea was prepared—whether the tea or milk was poured first. In contrast, this experiment involves a larger, more generalized sample of STA130 students. While the original test was more personalized and perhaps involved specialized knowledge, the current test focuses on the general population's ability to discern a subtle difference, potentially making it less personalized but more abstract in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements of the Null Hypothesis (H₀) and Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)\n",
    "1.Null Hypothesis (H₀): The students are randomly guessing whether tea or milk was poured first, implying that the probability of correctly guessing is 50%. Formal Statement: H₀: p=0.5 (where p is the proportion of students correctly identifying the pouring order). Informal Statement: The students cannot actually tell the difference and are just guessing, with a 50% chance of being correct. 2.Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The students are able to identify the pouring order better than random guessing. Formal Statement: Ha: p>0.5 Informal Statement: The students are not guessing randomly and have a better-than-chance ability to identify the order of pouring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "To evaluate the null hypothesis, we will perform a hypothesis test using a binomial distribution model. Given the sample size n=80 and the observed number of correct guesses x=49, we can compute the p-value to assess whether the observed outcome significantly deviates from what we’d expect under random guessing.\n"

    "1. Problem Introduction\n",
    "The problem is inspired by Fisher’s famous tea-tasting experiment. In the STA130 version of the experiment, 80 students are asked to taste tea and determine whether the milk or tea was poured first. Of these students, 49 correctly identify which was poured first. The goal is to statistically analyze whether this result could happen by random guessing or if the result suggests that students can indeed distinguish between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relationship Between This Experiment and Fisher's Original Experiment\n",
    "Fisher's Original Experiment involved Dr. Muriel Bristol, who claimed she could distinguish the order of tea and milk being poured. Fisher's test had 8 trials, where 4 cups had milk first, and 4 had tea first.\n",
    "STA130 Experiment involves a larger sample size (80 students) with just one cup per student, and the parameter of interest is more abstract—focusing on whether STA130 students, as a group, can distinguish between the tea and milk order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Null Hypothesis (H0) and Alternative Hypothesis (HA)\n",
    "Formal Null Hypothesis (H0): The students in STA130 are simply guessing whether the milk or tea was poured first. In other words, the proportion of students who correctly identify the pouring order is 0.5.\n",
    "Informal Statement of H0: The students are guessing and have a 50% chance of being right, just like flipping a coin.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The proportion of students who correctly identify the pouring order is greater than 0.5, indicating that students can distinguish the order.\n",
    "H A:p>0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "We will conduct a hypothesis test for proportions to determine whether the observed 49 correct answers out of 80 are significantly greater than the 50% expected under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Methodology\n",
    "The test statistic in this case will be the sample proportion,p^=49/80 = 0.6125\n",
    "We will use a one-sided z-test for proportions since we are testing if the proportion is greater than 0.5."

This would indicate that the proportion of students correctly identifying the tea order is greater than what we would expect by random chance alone, suggesting they have some ability to distinguish the order. If the p-value is not small, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which implies that the results are consistent with random guessing, and we have no evidence to suggest that students can identify the tea pouring order better than chance. Observed Proportion: p^=0.6125 Expected Proportion Under Ha: 50% P-value: The p-value from our analysis indicates the probability of observing 49 or more correct guesses purely by random chance if the true probability of guessing correctly is 50%.

    "### Ethical Professionalism Considerations\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using p-values and hypothesis testing appropriately is an important ethical and professional responsibility of anyone doing data analysis. Actually, there is quite the quiet Contra-Versy (or is it Con-TROV-ersy?) around p-values. First, on a general level, it seems quite clear that p-values and hypothesis testing methodologies MUST play some ongoing contributing role in the so-called \"replication crisis\" rampantly afflicting mordern science; namely, \"significant findings\" made in scientific studies are not able to be reproduced by future studies at an alarming rate; and, this whole paradigm of \"significant findings\" is based on p-values and hypothesis testing... so, something's going on with this methodology in some way...\n",
    "    \n",
    "More specifically however, p-values are themselves quite problematic. To see this, just briefly consider the following article titles...\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Why are p-values controversial?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1277161) \n",
    "- [What a nerdy debate about p-values shows about science and how to fix it](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005)\n",
    "- [The reign of the p-value is over: what alternative analyses could we employ to fill the power vacuum?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0174)\n",
    "- [Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9)\n",
    "- [Statistics experts urge scientists to rethink the p-value](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/statistics-experts-urge-scientists-rethink-p-value)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the issues here are relatively advanced and subtle (as introduced [here](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~berger/p-values.html), presented [here](https://www.jarad.me/courses/stat587Eng/slides/Inference/I06-Pvalues/why_pvalues_dont_mean_what_you_think_they_mean.pdf), and demonstrated using simulation [here](https://jaradniemi.shinyapps.io/pvalue/)), the problem essentially comes down to the fact that most scientists (or just people) don't know how to really interpret the numeric value of a p-value. There are therefore two current proposed solutions to address this challenge.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Just interpreting p-values using the follwing table (which really isn't that hard, so it's surprising that this solution isn't more broadly adopted...)\n",

    "|$$0.001 \\ge p$$|Very strong evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Only do **hypothesis testing** on the basis of confidence intervals, not **p-values** (which might be the best solution wherever doing so is a realistic, convenient  possibility...)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this quite broad introductory context in mind, what does your favorite ChatBot thinks about the following statements? \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Hypothesis testing is not a \"mathematical proof\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. We do not prove $H_0$ false, we instead give evidence against the $H_0$: \"We reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ, meaning we have ABC evidence against the null hypothesis\"\n",
    "    2. We do not prove $H_0$ is true, we instead do not have evidence to reject $H_0$: \"We fail to reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implying that a \"non-significant result\" means there is \"no effect\" misleads an audience because this may in actual fact simply indicate that there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So this therefore overlooks the possibility of sample size limitations, or Type II errors (which means a test incorrectly concludes that there is no effect or difference when, in fact, there is one). \n",
    "    \n",
    "> Similarly, analagously, a \"significant result\" used to reject the null hypothsis could alternatively be a Type I error (which means a test actually incorrectly rejected a null hypothesis when it was actually true)... we're only providing a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis... but the evidence could still incorrectly suggest the wrong conclusion... it really depends on how strong the evidence is...\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - all of which is why just interpreting p-values using the table above is a good idea...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The p-values used for hypothesis testing are contructed upone the assumptions of the null hypotheses they correspond to; but, null hypotheses are actually often presented in simple forms that routinely hide a lot of information that is implicitly used to construct the p-values. For example, distributional assumptions about the population, estimated \"plug-in\" values that can used to simplify the problem calculations, and the reliance upon \"random sampling\", etc...<br><br>\n",
    "           \n",
    "4. Drawing overly broad conclusions, or making recommendations based on findings that reject the null hypothesis in a specific context is fraught with the problematic risks of overgeneralization errors. Further exacerbating this issue, null hypotheses are typically so called \"point null hypotheses\" which is meant to emphasize that they are mathematically increadibly sharply specific; whereas, alternative hypotheses are usually very unspecific. An alternative hypothesis that \"the null hypothesis is false\" doesn't say much... we should wonder, \"how, specfically, is the null false?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "As an example really giving a demonstrating this, consider rejecting a null hypothesis that there is no correlation between rain and pizza's delivered. Such a decision doesn't specify what the actual hypothetical correlation might be. In fact, it doesn't even indicate if there are more or less pizzas delivered when it rains... \n",

    "> - a confidence interval provides a range of plausible values of what the parameter in question might be; whereas, ...\n",
    "> - trying to more clearly address what the plausible values of the parameter in question might be on the basis of hypothesis testing would require conducting further experiements to continously reject increasingly detailed hypothesies to narrow down what the alternative hypothesis might actually include... which would indeed be an utterly vapid misuse of the intended purpose of hypothesis testing entrprise... \n",
