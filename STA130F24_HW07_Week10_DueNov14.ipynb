Despite technically being **continuous** numbers, **integer** often simply indicate categories which should not necessarily be treated as an incremental **continuous predictor variable**. Remember, a model such as $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ means for each unit increase in $x$ the outcome increases \"on average\" by $\\beta_1$; so, if $x$ takes on the values `1` through `6` as the `Generation` **predictor variable** here does, then this means the average value for \"Generation 1\" must be $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$ while for \"Generation 2\" it must be $\\beta_0 + 2\\times \\beta_1$ (and so on up to \"Generation 6\" which must be $\\beta_0 + 6\\times \\beta_1$).

You can see in the given model fit below how this six-level **categorical predictor variable** is actually appropriately treated in the specification of the **linear form** using \"Generation 1\" for the \"baseline\" and **binary indicators** to model the \"contrast\" (\"offsets\") for the other \"Generations\"; and, how these are in turn used in the context of the **interaction** considered by the model specification._ \n",

    "> _The **overfitting** observed in the previous problem is a question of **model complexity** relative to the amount of information or evidence available in a given dataset (or we could just say \"the amount of data in a dataset\"). The **model fit** for  `model4` resulted in an **overfit model** because the specification of its **linear form** was overly complex (relative to the the amount of available data). Indeed, `model4` is rediculously complex as can be seen from `model4_fit.summary()`. This in turn allowed the **model fit** to \"detect\" idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. If a model is too **complex** then it will find and model \"patterns\" in a **training** dataset which are actually just accidental \"noise\" from the random sampling nature of the dataset. The simpler (or more parsimoneous) `model3` on the other hand was able to identify **predictive associations** in the **training** dataset which did **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. This is because `model3` only sought to understand simpler **predictive association** for which there was enough data in the **training** dataset to reliably detect and obviously identify. And these patterns were indeed sufficiently \"real\" in the sense that they were present and **generalized** into the **testing** dataset as well as the **training** dataset. So they could be \"found\" in the **training** and then used in (**generalized** to) the **testing** dataset._\n",
    "> \n",
    "> _This question therefore addresses the topic of the **evidence** a given dataset provides for the **predictive associations** detected by a **fitted model**. It should be increasingly clear at this point that evidence for a model can be addressed using **coefficent hypothesis testing** in the context of **multiple linear regression**, but that examinations of \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** metrics are what in fact are directly designed to address this question of **generalizability**. That said, this question introduces another consideration of **multicollinearity** as something that affects the **generalizability** of **model fits** in the **multiple linear regression** context. A good question that a ChatBot could help you understand is (a) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if two **predictor variables** are highly **correlated**?\" and (b) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if multiple **predictor variables** are highly **multicollinear**?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The four code cells below are not necessary for answering this question; however, they introduce two very practical helpful tools for the **multiple linear regression** context that are immediately relevant for this question. The first is the so-called **condition number** (of a \"design matrix\") which provides a very simple diagnostic which can serve as a measure the degree of **multicollinearity** that is present in a **model fit**. If this number is \"very large\" then there is a large degree of **multicollinearity** and suggests room for doubt regarding the **generalizability** of the **fitted model**. The second tool(s) are the `center` and `scale` functions. It is best practice to \"center and scale\" **continuous predictor variables** (but not **indicator variables**) in the **multiple linear regression** context as is done below. While \"centering and scaling\" does make interpreting the predictions on the original scale of the data slighly more complicated, it also must be done in order to get a \"true\" evaluation of the degree of **multicollinearity** present in a **model fit** using the **condition number** of the model (\"design matrix\"). The examples below show that the **condition number** reported by a **fitted model** are \"artificially inflacted\" if \"centering and scaling\" is not used. Specically, they show that the **condition number** of `model3_fit` is really `1.66` (as opposed to the \"very large\" `343` which is reported without \"centering and scaling\"); whereas, the **condition number** for `model4_fit` is \"very (VERY) large\" irrespective of \"centering and scaling\", showing that the overwheling presense of **multicollinearity** in `model4_fit` is in fact a very real thing.  Indeed, we have already seen that `model4_fit` is grossly **overfit** and does not remotely **generalize** beyond its **training** dataset. Without knowing this, however, the comically large **condition number** for `model4_fit` (after \"centering and scaling\") makes it abundantly clear that we should have great doubts about the likely **generalizability** of `model4_fit` (even without examining specific aspects of **multicollinearity** directly or examining \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** comparisions)._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _The \"specific aspects of **multicollinearity**\" reference above refer to understanding and attributing the detrmimental affects of specific **predictor variables** towards **multicollinearity**. This can be done using so-called **variance inflation factors**, but this is beyond the scope of STA130. We should be aware that the presence of excessive **multicollinearity** as indicated by a large **condition number** for a (\"centered and scaled\") **fitted model** raises grave concerns regarding the potential **generalizability** of the model._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The `np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)` examination of the **correlations** of a \"design matrix\" considered in ths problems prompt is analogous to the examination of the **correlations** present in a dataset that might considered when initially examining the **predictor variables** of a dataset, such as `pokeaman.iloc[:,4:12].corr()`. Indeed, such an examination is often the first step in examining the potential presence of **multicollinearity** among the **predictor variables** of a dataset. However, these are consideration of **pairwise correlation**, whereas **multicollinearity** generalizes this notion to the full collection of **predictor variables** together. A **condition number** for a \"centered and scale\" version of a **fit model** can therefore be viewed as serving the analogous purposes of a multivariate generalization of **pairwise correlation**._\n",

    "Goal: Centering and scaling continuous variables in Model 7 further reduce multicollinearity by standardizing variable scales.\n",
    "Condition Number Improvement: The condition number drops significantly (from 2.34 billion to 15.4), indicating that the model is less susceptible to multicollinearity, enhancing out-of-sample prediction."

Take a moment to think about why the code repeatedly randomly re-splits the data, fits the model, and compares the \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **R-squared** values (over and over). Of course, if a **fit model** performs well on the **training** dataset but doesn't do as well on the **testing** dataset then we might be observing the affects of **overfitting**. But why might it sometimes be the opposite situation (which we actually encountered right away for `model3_fit` when the **train-test split** was based on  `np.random.seed(130)` and resulted in a better \"out of sample\" **R-squared** of about `0.21` vereses the 'in-sample\" **R-squared** of about `0.15`)? If you're thinking that this should therefore vice-versa intuitively mean **underfitting**, actually that's not right because **underfitting** is when the **generalizability** of a different model **linear form** specification that provides improved **model performance** is **validated**. What were seeing here, the variable, is something else..._\n",

    "> _While we had seemed to **validate** the **generalizability** of `model7_fit` in **model building** exercise of the previous \"Question 7\" above, as well as the improved **model performance** of `model7_fit` comapred to `model6_fit`, the `model7_fit` model was always nonetheless more complex than `model6_fit` model (as seen by comparing their `.summary()` methods). This complexity, despite the minimal concerns regarding **multicollinearity**, should always have suggested some room for caution. This is because, as previously discussed in \"Question 6\" above, a complex **linear form** specification can allow a \"**model fit** to 'detect' idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset.\" Indeed, a close look at the **p-values** in `model7_fit.summary()` will show that the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model7_fit` is in fact not very strong. In comparision, the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model6_fit.summary()` is consistently stronger._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _As discussed towards the end of the commentary in the previous \"Question 7\" above, the primary purpose of **multiple linear regression** methodology is to allow us to assess the **evidence** (in the data) for a given **linear form** specification based on **coefficient hypothesis testing**. In this regard, then, `model6_fit` might be preferred over `model7_fit` despite the better \"out of sample\" **model performance** of `model7_fit` over `model6_fit`. This may not be enough to convince everyone however, so an additional consideration that might be made here is that the more simpler (more parsimoneous) nature of `model6_fit` should be preferred over `model7_fit` from the perspective of **model interpretability**. Indeed, it is quite unclear how exactly one should think about and understand a four-way **interaction** variable such as `Attack:Speed:Q(\"Sp. Def\"):Q(\"Sp. Atk\")` in conjunction with the whole host of the additional lower order interations. From a **model interpretability** perspective, understanding the meaning of the complex specification of `model7_fit` is \"challenging\" and \"complicated\" to say the least._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _There are also often circumstances where **model interpretability** can be MORE IMPORTANT than raw **model performance** in \"out of sample\" **prediction**._\n",
    "> - _This is ESPECIALLY true if **predictive model performance** is relatively comparable between models of two different complexity levels. In such cases, the benefits of better **model interpretability** might provide a clear argument for the simpler (more parsimoneous) model, not to mention the additional potential benefit of more consistent improved **generalizability** over the the more complex model this might offer._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _This question drives home the point that a simpler (more parsimoneous) model always offers the potential benefit of more consistent **generalizability**, not to mention **interpretability**, over more complex models. We should *ONLY* use increasingly complex models that without questions outperfrm simler models. The code below illustrates this by further additionally raising the consideration that the random **train-test** approach used above is actually not the most natural one available for our dataset, which has different \"Generations\". In fact, if we were actually using this model to make **predictions**, we would increasingly acquire more data over time which we would use to make **precictions** about future data which we haven't yet seen, which is what the code demonstrates. And low and behold, this exposes **generalizability** concerns that we missed when we used the dataset in an idealized way and not actually how we would use such a dataset in practice in the real world (where data would arrive sequentially, and current data is used to predict future data). These **generalizability** concerns do affect both models, but the appear to be more problematic for `model7_fit` than `model6_fit`, which is certainly a result of the increased complexity of `model7_fit` which always opens up the possibility of model **overfitting**._\n",
